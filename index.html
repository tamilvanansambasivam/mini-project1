<h1>CODING TIPS</h1>
<div>
    Write clean and readable code: Always write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. 
    Use descriptive variable and function names, break up long lines of code, and use comments to explain your thought process.
</div>

<div>
    Test your code: Testing your code regularly is essential to ensure it's functioning as expected. 
    Write test cases for your code and try to cover as many edge cases as possible.
</div>
<div>
    Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your code changes. 
    This will help you keep track of changes, collaborate with other developers, and roll back changes if necessary.
</div>

<div>Learn from others: Follow experienced developers and learn from their coding practices. 
    Join coding communities and participate in code reviews to gain insights into how others approach coding.</div>

</body>

<div>Keep learning: Programming is an ever-evolving field, so it's essential to keep learning. 
    Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry and continually improve your skills.
</div>

<div>Write modular code: Writing modular code allows you to reuse code and makes it easier to maintain. 
    Break up your code into smaller, reusable functions and classes, and try to keep each function focused on a single task.
</div>
<div>
    Debugging skills: Debugging skills are crucial to solving problems in your code. 
    Learn how to use debugging tools like breakpoints, print statements, and logs to track down bugs in your code.
</div>
<div>
    Code documentation: Writing code documentation helps other developers understand your code, 
    and it can help you remember why you wrote a particular code snippet. Write comments, add docstrings, 
    and use code documentation tools to generate documentation automatically.
</div>
<div>
    Stay organized: Keep your code organized by using a consistent file structure and naming convention. 
</div>
<div>
    Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice coding, the better you'll become. 
    Write code every day, work on coding challenges, and build projects to hone your skills.
